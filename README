OMNIBOMNS
=========

Bomns. The tap-happy, set-your-hair-on-fire, blow-up-your-friends, deathmatch
classic. In your browser!


WHAT THE HELL?
--------------
It's quite simple, really. Two players -- one red and one blue -- out for
blood. Attack your opponent with all of your might! A bomn (with an n!) does 5
damage, and "punching" your opponent (by running into them) does 1 damage.


CONTROLS
--------
Player 1:
  Movement:  arrow keys
  Drop bomn: enter

Player 2:
  Movement:  w, a, s, d
  Drop bomn: spacebar


POWERUPS (AND POWERDOWNS)
-------------------------
You can collect more bomns, health, and powerups that raise your blast radius.
There are also powerDOWNS that lower your blast radius, so be careful! The
yellow stars are invulnerability powerups -- collect one and you'll be
impervious to harm for 10 seconds.


WARPS
-----
Those multicolored swirly doo-dads are warps. Step into one and hope for the
best -- you'll be transported to a random part of the level. If you're lucky,
it won't be into the blast radius of a bomn!
